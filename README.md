## Summary

My motivation was to gain skills in object oriented programming. I built this project to gain skills with subjects such as Jest and TDD. It solves the problem of creating an SVG file to generate a logo. I learned a lot about back end coding including how to write a new file and more about constructors and classes. My project stands out because it is a simple and efficient way to generate a logo.

## Usage Instructions

The application is run by entering node index.js.
