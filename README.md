My motivation was to gain skills in object oriented programming.

I built this project to gain skills with subjects such as Jest and TDD.

It solves the problem of creating an SVG file to generate a logo.

I learned a lot about back end coding including how to write a new file and more about constructors and classes.

My project stands out because it is a simple and efficient way to generate a logo.

The application is run by entering node index.js.
